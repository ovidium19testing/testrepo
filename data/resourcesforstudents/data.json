But placements are learning environments too. Students have to acknowledge that the learning is taking place in a “real world” clinical health delivery space, as such the rules of engagement are different. Ensure you clearly understand the purpose of your placement, what you want to achieve and the level of your commitment. Do your best to learn as much as you can and demonstrate to show educators and mentors that you are dedicated student who has a lot to learn. The educators and mentors would like to know your scope of practice and will be happy to help you when you make mistakes"

Cooperation between group members was at risk because of this perception of unfairness. Social interdependence theory recognises a type of group interaction called ‘positive interdependence’, meaning cooperation (Johnson &\nJohnson, 1993, cited by Maughan & Webb, 2001), and many studies have demonstrated that “cooperative learning experiences encourage higher achievement” (Maughan & Webb, 2001).  Ultimately, our group achieved a successful outcome, but to improve the process, we perhaps needed a chairperson to help encourage cooperation when tasks were being shared out. In future group work, on the course and at work, I would probably suggest this."
