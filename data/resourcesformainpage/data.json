The resource is designed to inform and support students with a mental health problem or those with a specific learning disability. Students with hidden disabilities often approach placement with significantly more anxiety then their colleagues because they require reasonable adjustments that may not be readily be available to them in a clinical setting. This resource will be available to students, clinical educators/mentors and lecturers with a view to ensuring that all stakeholders understand the processes and mechanisms for supporting a student on placement. If students can access the support they need before the placement begins, they are less likely to lack confidence during the placement and have the opportunity to have a smooth and rewarding placement experience."
